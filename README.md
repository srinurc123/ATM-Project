Project Overview :
This project is a backend-only Java application that simulates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The system manages user accounts, verifies login credentials, and allows users to perform essential banking operations such as balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal.

Tech Stack Used :
Java (Core Java: OOPs, Collections, Exception Handling)
MySQL Database (for storing account and transaction details)
JDBC (to connect Java with MySQL)
Postman/Console (used for testing and interaction)

Features Implemented :
User authentication using account number and PIN

Check account balance :
Deposit amount into account
Withdraw amount with balance validation
Maintain transaction history in the database
Exception handling for invalid inputs and insufficient balance

My Role :
I designed and implemented the complete backend of the application, including the account database structure, Java classes for account management, and JDBC connectivity for real-time operations with MySQL.

Application Workflow :
User logs in with account number and PIN.
ATM menu is displayed with available options. 
User selects an operation (Balance, Deposit, Withdraw).
Java backend processes the request via JDBC and updates MySQL records.
User receives confirmation and updated balance.

Learning Outcome :
This project helped me understand real-time banking logic, database integration using JDBC, and how backend systems handle sensitive operations like authentication and transactions securely.
